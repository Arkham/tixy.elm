# Minimal Elm + Parcel deploy to Netlify

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9429c584-fc7a-4812-9ebb-df8a3ae3ca92/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/elm-netlify-parcel/deploys) [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/JoelQ/elm-netlify-parcel)

This is a minimal example [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) app that is deployed to
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (see the [live site](https://elm-netlify-parcel.netlify.app/)).

## Using this yourself

This is a [GitHub template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
which allows you to initialize your own repo with the same files and directories
as this (but not the history). To start using, click the big "Use this template"
button at the top of the page.

## Setup without parcel

[sister `elm-netlify-minimal` project](https://github.com/JoelQ/elm-netlify-minimal).
